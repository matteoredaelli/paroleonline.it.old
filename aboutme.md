My name is  Matteo Redaelli and I'm a big fan of OpenSource software. This site runs several Opensource softwares:

- [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) for calling REST APIs and generating dynamic contents
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) for indexing some contents
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (for generating this - not so - static web site. It runs on a poor RaspBerry PI2 hardware ;-)
- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) as Web Server)
- [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) as Application/Rest server

I decided to switch from [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) to a static generated web site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
